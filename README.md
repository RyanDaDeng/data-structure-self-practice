# AlgoCasts

Companion repo to a course on Udemy.com


This is branched from https://github.com/StephenGrider/algocasts

This will be my own practice repo, currently it does not have any solutions. I will practice each problem along with my studying progress.

# Set up

- ensure that node -v greater than v8.0
- run npm install -g jest
- run test e.g. jest fib/test.js --watch
