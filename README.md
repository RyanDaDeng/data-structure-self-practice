# About this repo
This is a companion repo to a course on Udemy.com. This is branched from https://github.com/StephenGrider/algocasts


# Notes

This will be my own practice repo, initially the repo does not have any solutions. I will practice each problem along with my studying progress.

For each exercise, I will include a readme file with my own personal notes and description.
